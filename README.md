## Lessons Learned: 
I practiced my process of converting a frontend application into a full stack application. Once the palindrome worked using frontend main.js, I added the functionality to the backend server.js with express and node.js. To reverse the word I took the input as a string and used the methods of split, reverse, and join. The new word was then compared against the original word and the application would return if it is a palindrome or not. After I added update and delete capabilities for fun.
